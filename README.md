Project - Application of ML in Predicting the Prices of Five Selected Cryptocurrencies

Project Goal: To train a machine learning model using the MLPRegressor() class from the scikit-learn library to predict the price behaviors of the following cryptocurrencies:
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot, Cardano, and Solana. The model is intended to predict changes in closing prices as well as their absolute values based on the following indicators:

Opening price
Maximum price
Minimum price
Volume
Simple Moving Average (SMA), 50-period
Simple Moving Average (SMA), 200-period
Relative Strength Index (RSI), 14-period
Upper Bollinger Band
